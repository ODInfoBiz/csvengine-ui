# CSV Engine
The "CSV Engine" is a web server offering a set of services to handle and process CSV files. One of the main feature in the current version is an editor to create an initial version of the **[CSV on the Web metadata standard file](https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page)**. 

We hope that people find this tool useful and will join or contribute to the project by providing feedback, bug reports, feature requests or code contributions.

## Under the hood
The tool is implemented in Python 2.7 using the FLASK web server framework and the Jinja2 template engine. 

The frontend is using the [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html) framework for the layout and some basic Javascripts.
